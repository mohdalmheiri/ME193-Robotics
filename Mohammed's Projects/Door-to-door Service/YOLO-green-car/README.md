# YOLO-green-car

Luca's Part 2 code, copied from
[Lucalo44/ME193-Code](https://github.com/Lucalo44/ME193-Code/tree/main/Door2Door).

Trains a YOLOv8 nano model to detect a single class, `Minifig`. It starts
from `yolov8n.pt` (pretrained on COCO) and fine-tunes it on our own photos.

## Dataset

Put the Roboflow YOLOv8 export in `YOLO-green-car/dataset/`, so that
`YOLO-green-car/dataset/data.yaml` exists next to the `train/`, `valid/` and
`test/` folders.

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

From this folder:

```
python train.py
```

It trains on the Apple Silicon GPU (`mps`) and falls back to the CPU if
that isn't available. When it finishes, the trained model is copied to
`YOLO-green-car/best.pt`. The full training output stays in `runs/`, which git
ignores.

## Detect, compute a motor speed, and publish over MQTT

The camera here is stationary -- it's not mounted on the car. It watches
the car (which carries the green minifig as its own marker) drive back and
forth along a straight track, the same setup as
`aprilTags/apriltag_pd_tracker.py` in Luca's ME193-Code repo. `detect_publish.py`
runs `best.pt` on that camera feed, computes a single PD-controlled
forward/backward speed to park the car at the frame's center (no left/right
steering -- both motors get the same speed, sign-corrected for
mirror-mounting via `RIGHT_MOTOR_SIGN`), and publishes it to the
`broker.hivemq.com` broker (port 1883) on topic `ME193/Luca/green`.

The control math (centering gains, deadzone, slew rate, distance scaling)
runs here instead of on the UNO Q on purpose: tuning it is then just
editing a constant (or dragging a trackbar) and rerunning this script, not
redeploying to the board through App Lab. **Kp/Kd/Min Speed/Deadzone/Max
Step/Smoothing/Send Rate trackbars on the preview window let you retune
live, without even restarting it.**

Each message is JSON, extending the format used by the professor's MQTT
Minifig Monitor:

```
{"x": 412.0, "y": 230.5, "w": 640, "h": 480, "conf": 0.91, "left": -80, "right": 80}
```

`x`, `y` are the center of the minifig's box in pixels and `w`, `h` are
the camera frame size; `left`/`right` are the same forward/backward speed
(-255..255) for the UNO Q to apply as-is to each motor (right is
sign-flipped for mirror-mounting, so the two will usually show opposite
signs even though the car drives straight, not in place). The box's
apparent width scales the speed -- farther away (smaller box) drives
faster, closer (bigger box) drives slower. Only the single most confident
detection in the frame is sent, at most 10 times a second. Nothing is
sent for a frame with no detection -- the UNO Q hard-stops the motors on
its own if messages stop arriving for too long (see
`ArduinoApps/mqtt-minifig-drive/python/main.py`'s `CONTROL_TIMEOUT`).

A video window shows the detections, the current left/right speeds, the
box width and distance factor, a red line at the center of the frame (the
stopping point), and the tuning trackbars described above. Press `q` in
that window to quit.

Run it from this `YOLO-green-car` folder:

```
python detect_publish.py
```

The script `os.chdir()`s to this folder and loads the model by its short
name, so `python detect_publish.py` works regardless of your current
directory.

If it opens the wrong camera (for example your iPhone), change `CAMERA`
at the top of the script to `1`.

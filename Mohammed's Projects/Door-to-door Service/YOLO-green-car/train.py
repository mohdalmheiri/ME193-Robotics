train.py - fine-tune YOLOv8 to find the LEGO minifigure.

Dataset: dataset/ (Roboflow YOLOv8 export, a single class, Minifig,
137 images split 96 train / 27 valid / 14 test).

We start from yolov8n.pt (the "nano" model, pretrained on the COCO dataset) and
fine-tune it on our own photos. That's much faster than training from scratch
and works well with only a hundred or so images.

Run from this folder:   python train.py
Result:                 best.pt  (copied here from runs/detect/minifigs/weights/)
